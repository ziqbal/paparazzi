run.sh should return to starting directory not APP directory

have log file
- when script gets run by cron etc



no clock!! watch out for timestamp being the same or lower!
- load data file with counter?



int ch;
    /* read character by character from stdin */
    do {
    ch = fgetc(stdin);
    putchar(ch);
    } while (ch != EOF);

   ch = fgetc(stdin);
                if(ch==32){
                        printf("zzz\n");
                }
