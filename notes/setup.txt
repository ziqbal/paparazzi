The other solutions here did not work for me (fresh Raspbian, boot to GUI). Instead, this worked:

    Open up /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf using your favorite text editor (I prefer nano).
    Look for the line #xserver-command=X. Change it to xserver-command=X -s 0 dpms
        It should be at line 87 if things don't change.
    Save and reboot.



s -l (list the contents of the .ssh directory, view permissions and ownership)
chmod 700 ~/.ssh/ (set permissions for the .ssh directory)
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (set permissions for your key file)
ls -l (check permissions were changed properly)â€¦

export DISPLAY=:0.0

add #!/bin/bash to client cron.sh script

#!/bin/bash

. /media/pi/UNTITLEDX/cassopi/scripts/run.sh


//// RAM DISK
#!/bin/bash
sudo mkdir -p /ram
sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=100m tmpfs /ram



/////
sudo ./paparazzi/scripts/kill.sh ;sleep 3;tar zxvf paparazzi.tar.gz;sudo ./paparazzi/scripts/run.sh
